**Earth2Vec** is a community-driven initiative to accelerate research and 
real-world applications of Earth Observation embeddings.

With the goal of shaping the transformative potential of 
Earth Observation embeddings, we define standards for data formats and 
benchmarking, explore real-world use cases and foster open-source collaboration.

The community is open to everyone interested in the topic, please create an [onboarding request](https://github.com/earth2vec/earth2vec.github.io/issues/new/choose) to be added to the community.
